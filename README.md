# Encryption
## Introduction
A simple project using Vigenère cipher(slightly different) to encrypt/decrypt characters(numbers or English letters) in C++.
## Encryption method
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. If you want to know the details, you can go to Wikipedia to read. Next we will talk about the difference between my encryption method and the Vigenère cipher.<br>
Vigenère cipher uses the following form to transfer characters to numbers.<br>

In order to enter letters that you can include uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. I use the following homemade table to convert the input characters.
